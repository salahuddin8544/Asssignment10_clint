            <p>FAQ pages continue to be a priority area for SEO and digital marketing professionals.</p>
            <p>An FAQ page is one of the simplest ways to improve your site and help site visitors and users.</p>

            <p>In no small part, the importance of FAQ pages has been driven in recent years by the growth in voice search, mobile search, and personal/home assistants and speakers.</p>
